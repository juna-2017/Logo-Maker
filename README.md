  This assignment was worked with tutor Thomas Gilmore who assisted in getting it started, and helped in getting the unit testings to pass.
  

  ## Tests
  To run unit testing, run command 'npm run test' in the terminal. There is currently 1 test suite with three tests, which are checking for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.
